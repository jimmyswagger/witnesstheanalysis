Hi,
Hope you are well. 

I really enjoy the content you produce and am currently working with some teams as a performance analyst. 

My background is in data science and analytics so I am quite familiar with the R coding and programmes you are running. 

Currently I provide my teams information on kick outs and shot locations much like you have in your koshot tracker 
and add some context such as quantifying value of each KO and shot with expected points etc. 

Iâ€™m trying to assess the feasibility of producing a similar level of detailed analysis such as https://witnesstheanalysis.com/dubkerfr.html.

I was wondering could you provide some more detail on how you are tracking each action and the time taken to log these events. 

It seems to me the best way would be to watch video and log each action/event on a pitch map similar to your rugby tracker. 

What is the level of effort to do this - 2-3 hours per game? 

Any resources or pointers would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks for your help in advance.
Regards,
Diarmuid

Hi Diarmuid 

Very nice to hear from you

Its definitely possible to create detailed analysis it just depends on how much time you want to dedicate to it

Its based on watching the video and tagging each event. 

Im not sure time wise how quickly you could do it using rstudio

I have been using a userform in excel to do it similar to the examples here https://witnesstheanalysis.wordpress.com/2019/07/21/using-excel-to-create-a-match-tracker/

you could look into nacsports, performa sports etc but as far as im aware there is a fee to use them

I have just created this which I hope can be of some use to you if you have windows

Some tips and ideas - Im sure there isnt much different here to working with any kind of data 

Sequence for Coding a Game
1.Team details (Numbers names subs etc)
2.Code Game (save after set points of time)
3.Clean Data (excel formulas and R)
4.Assign Data
5.Load to R & Visualise 
6.Upload to website 


* what needs to be tracked (Im looking at everything that I can think of that can be tracked. It could be worth talking to the coaches that you are working with as to what they want. 
They may not need as much detail although in saying that it could be up to you to show them what they are missing)
* It wil be harder to go in to too much detail if you are coding the game live 
* Templates - automate as much as possible (I use team "A" & "B" and then a different column with the team names so dont have to change the code for different games)
this is an example of what the log looks like and then after I have cleaned it 
* If you are going in to a lot of detail it can make it easier to filter etc on R by grouping actions together 
for example (if you are using R shiny for this it is probably simpler to do this in excel)
          
          Main - Shot Open Play
          Subset - Shot Op
          Action - Shot Left
          
* Take time to make sure your data is clean and correct before you start analyising/visualising it - I use a mix of excel and R for this 
* Finding a way to highlight errors - Things like conditional formating in excel 
* Easy retrieval of codes and ideas - so a good system for storing codes etc and for interesting websites/articles
* Im just learning as I go along so one of the main things is finding ideas and working backwards from there.
  figuring out how to ask google the right questions and then finding the right code  
  here is a good starting place for ideas https://wikieducator.org/Sport_Informatics_and_Analytics/Pattern_Recognition/Using_R and following people on twitter not just GAA 
* Keep a master copy of the cleaned data and use a different file/sheet for analysis - so mistakes arent permenant 

Time
* Time wise - it all very much depends on the level of detail (Id say any where between 6-8 hours to do a game not including the r work-
It should probably only take about 3-4 hours but Im not under any deadline so I do it at a more leisurely pace)
* A couple of things that can affect the speed of the coding 
	*Coding the games from the tv coverage adds a bit of time to it due to changing camera angles, replays etc it helps having a fixed camera
	*intercounty games take a lot longer than club games too (more actions and a lot more injury time)
	*having the team details, when subs are made any cards etc before you start coding speeds things up to 
*The more you can automate the better 

I'll try and do up a list of other resources etc that might be of help

Any further questions dont be afraid to get in touch
