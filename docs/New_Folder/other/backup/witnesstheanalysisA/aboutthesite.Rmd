Having a look at different ways to present GAA analysis, mainly Gaelic football, match data and statistics.

Using the data to get to grips with r, excel, databases, analysis and data visualisation among other things.

The overall aim is to see how much can be automated to help speed up the process of analysing games

Also as this is very much a work in progress I will be adding bits as I go along. 

There are of course the odd mistakes here and there
